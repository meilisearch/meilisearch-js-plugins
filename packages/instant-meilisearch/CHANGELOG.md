## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 234d699: - exposed created `MeiliSearch` instance

  - re-exported all of `"meilisearch"` package

  These improvements make it so that no separate `"meilisearch"` package
  has to be installed in order to use its exports directly. This
  way a single `MeiliSearch` instance can be re-used, and we can potentially
  save on bundle size by avoiding a separate different version installation of
  `"meilisearch"`.

  ```typescript
  import {
    instantMeiliSearch,
    meilisearch,
  } from "@meilisearch/instant-meilisearch";
  // re-exported "meilisearch" ^

  const {
    meiliSearchInstance,
    // ^ re-usable MeiliSearch instance
    searchClient,
  } = instantMeiliSearch(/*...*/);
  ```

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 5b6be19 & ed8b6a3: Added ability to override a selection of Meilisearch search parameters.

  ⚠️ The returned value of the core `instantMeiliSearch` function has changed!

  This change was necessary for the aforementioned ability to be implemented and
  applied in a clean manner.
  The necessary migration should be of minimal impact.

  ### Migration

  Change the following

  ```js
  // 1.
  const client = instantMeiliSearch(/*...*/);
  // 2.
  const searchClient = instantMeiliSearch(/*...*/);
  // 3.
  instantsearch({
    indexName: "movies",
    searchClient: instantMeiliSearch(/*...*/),
  });
  ```

  to the following

  ```js
  // 1.
  const { searchClient: client } = instantMeiliSearch(/*...*/);
  // 2.
  const { searchClient } = instantMeiliSearch(/*...*/);
  // 3.
  instantsearch({
    indexName: "movies",
    searchClient: instantMeiliSearch(/*...*/).searchClient,
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 06377ef: Fixes issue where backslashes ("\") and quotes (`"`) are not escaped in filters.

  ⚠️ This impacts the facet distribution number

  ## Drawback

  Currently, for each `facet value` selected in a different `facet` a separate request is made to Meilisearch. Plus, an additional one containing all the facets filters. It results in tedious search requests and a high bandwidth cost.
  For example, if I select `Adventure` on genres and `Multiplayer` on players, one request is made with both facet filters, one with only `genres=Adventure` and one with only `players=Multiplayer`

  In the next release of Meilisearch, a new `multi-search` API route is planned to be released (see [PR](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/3417)). When it is released, the work-around will be removed and only one HTTP request will be done in all cases!

  ## Explanation

  The way the `facetDistribution` is calculated changed. The `facetDistribution` shows the numbers of hits for each facet. For example:

  Given the following facet:

  ```
  Genres
  - [ ] Adventure 7
  ```

  The `facetDistribution` provides the information that there are `7` hits containing the adventure genre.

  For the example, let's take the following facets:

  ```
  Genres
  - [ ] Adventure 7
  - [ ] Action 5
  - [ ] Science Fiction 5
  Players
  - [ ] Multiplayer 11
  - [ ] Single player 7
  ```

  Before, when selecting a facet value in a certain facet, the distribution of that facet was impacted.

  ```
  - [x] Adventure 7
  - [ ] Action 3 // <- number changed from 5 to 3
  - [ ] Science Fiction 1 // <- number changed from 5 to 1
  Players
  - [ ] Multiplayer 6
  - [ ] Single player 3
  ```

  With the new behavior, the distributed number are not changed when facet values are selected inside the same facet because a facet distribution is computed with a dedicated search request.

  ```
  Genres
  - [x] Adventure 7
  - [ ] Action 5 // <- number did not change
  - [ ] Science Fiction 5 // <- number did not change
  Players
  - [ ] Multiplayer 6
  - [ ] Single player 3
  ```

  ```
  Genres
  - [x] Adventure 7 // changed because of Multiplayer
  - [ ] Action 4
  - [ ] Science Fiction 3
  Players
  - [x] Multiplayer 6
  - [ ] Single player 3
  ```

  This is the conventional way of calculating the facet distribution. Similar to Algolia's behavior. If you prefer the old behavior, please consider opening an issue.

  See [complete explanation here](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js-plugins/issues/884)

- 72de4c8: - Compatibility with the `Index` widget is added.

  ## Drawback

  Currently, for each index a request is made on, a separated request is made to Meilisearch. For example, if you have two indexes on which to search, two http requests are made.

  In the next release of Meilisearch, a new `multi-search` API route is planned to be released (see [PR](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/3417)). When it is released, the work-around will be removed and only one HTTP request will be done in all cases!
