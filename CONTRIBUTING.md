- [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)
- [Git Guidelines](#git-guidelines)
- [Release Process (for internal team only)](#release-process-for-internal-team-only)

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Meilisearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [Meilisearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the instant-meilisearch repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main instant-meilisearch repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### Setup <!-- omit in TOC -->

```bash
yarn --dev
```

### Tests and Linter <!-- omit in TOC -->

Each PR should pass the tests and the linter to be accepted.

```bash
# Tests with Jest
docker pull getmeili/meilisearch:latest # Fetch the latest version of Meilisearch image from Docker Hub
docker run -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch:latest meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics
# Integration tests
yarn test
# End-to-end tests
yarn test:e2e
# Linter
yarn lint
# Linter with fixing
yarn lint:fix
# Build the project
yarn build
```

### Playgrounds <!-- omit in TOC -->

To test directly your changes in `instant-meilisearch`, you can run the Vue playground:

```bash
yarn playground:vue
```

Or the React playground:

```bash
yarn playground:react
```

Or the JavaScript playground:
```
yarn playground:javascript
```

Or the HTML playground:
```
yarn playground:html
```

### Geo-Search Playground

A playground is available to try out the [GeoSearch](./README.md/-geo-search) in `instant-meilisearch`.

```bash
yarn playground:geo-javascript
```

Note: If the Google Maps stopped working, please create a new [Google Api Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and add it in the `.env` file at the root of the playground: `/playgrounds/geo-javascript`

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in TOC -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in TOC -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### Changesets <!-- omit in TOC -->

We use [changesets](https://github.com/Noviny/changesets) to do versioning. What that means is that you need to [add a changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) by running `yarn changeset`. The changeset you create contains what packages should be bumped, their associated semver type and the changelogs.

These changesets are added in the `.changesets` directory at the root of the repository, and should be added in your PR.
Once there is a [release](#release-on-github-and-npm), these files are automatically removed.

Some changes do [not require a changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md#not-every-change-requires-a-changeset). For example changes that does not impact the packages, e.g. : Updating the README.md or changes in tests files.

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in TOC -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch/releases/).

## Release Process (for the internal team only)

Meilisearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

### Automation to Rebase and Merge the PRs <!-- omit in TOC -->

This project integrates a bot that helps us manage pull requests merging.<br>

### Release on Github and npm

This repository uses the [changesets](https://github.com/Noviny/changesets) library to handle the version updates and the publishing on Github and `npm`.

When PR's are merged on `main`, they trigger the [`release` CI](./.github/workflows/publish.yml). This CI creates a PR titled `Version Packages` containing all the version updates and changelogs of the impacted packages. The PR updates the versions and the changelogs based on the `changesets` that were previously pushed on main (see [changeset section](#changesets)).

To release on Github and `npm` you must merge the `Version packages` PR. This will trigger the publishing action and create the Github and `npm` releases for all affected packages.

See more in depth explaination on [versioning](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/command-line-options.md#version), [publishing](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/command-line-options.md#publish) and the [changesets github-action](https://github.com/changesets/action).

If you were previously on `pre-release mode`, do not forget to create a PR exiting the pre-release mode by doing `yarn changeset pre exit` and then merge it to main.

#### Codesandbox update
Once the version is available on npm, please update the instant-meilisearch version used in the different Code-Sandboxes we provide:

- [Meilisearch + InstantSearch](https://codesandbox.io/s/ms-is-mese9)
- [Meilisearch + Vue 2 InstantSearch](https://codesandbox.io/s/ms-vue-is-1d6bi)
- [Meilisearch + Vue 3 InstantSearch](https://codesandbox.io/s/ms-vue3-is-0293zk)
- [Meilisearch + React InstantSearch](https://codesandbox.io/s/ms-react-is-sh9ud)

If you don't have the access to do it, please request it internally.

#### Release a `beta` Version

This package is able to create multiple types of betas:
- A standard package beta, working on the latest version of Meilisearch.
- A beta implementing the changes of a rc version of Meilisearch.
- A beta implementing a specific feature `prototype` of Meilisearch.

Here are the steps to release a beta version of this package depending on its type:

1. Create a new branch containing the changes with the correct name format following these rules:
    - `package beta`: create a branch `beta/xx-xx` with the context of your beta.
      Example: `beta/refactor`.
    - Meilisearch `pre-release beta`: create a branch originating from `bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*` named `pre-release-beta/v*.*.*`. <br>
      Example: `pre-release-beta/v0.30.0`
    - Meilisearch `prototype beta`: create a branch `prototype-beta/xx-xx`. Where `xxx` has the same name as the docker image containing the prototype.
        Example: If the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/getmeili/meilisearch/tags) is named: `v0.29.0-pagination.beta.2`, the branch should be named: `prototype-beta/pagination`

2. Enable the pre-release mode by running `yarn changeset pre enter [X]`. `X` is the part after the `/` of your beta branch. Example for `beta/refactor`, X would be `refactor`. This will create a `pre.json` file in `.changesets` that must be pushed on your beta branch.

3. Commit and push your related PR's to the newly created branch (step 1).

4. When a PR is merged onto your beta branch, the [release CI](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) opens a PR named `Version Packages (X)` (see step 2 for `X`). This PR contains all the changesets and the version update based on the type of changes in the changesets.

5. To publish the release on Github and `npm`, you need to merge the `Version Packages (X)` PR. This will trigger the publishing.
