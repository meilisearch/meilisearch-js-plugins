# Javascript GeoSearch Playground

The provided Google Maps API Key is limited to 300 requests per day, so it might be down sometimes. In which case, please create a new [Google API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and add it in the `.env` file at the root of the playground: `/playgrounds/geo-javascript`.

The same dataset is [downloadable here](https://github.com/meilisearch/datasets/tree/main/datasets/world_cities) if you want to try it out on your own Meilisearch.
