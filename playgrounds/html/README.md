# MeiliSearch Simple Game Search

This repository is a **playground**, all the following files are hot-reloading:

- _ROOT_/src/\*
- _ROOT_/template/basic_search.css
- ./public/index.html

meaning you can change the code of this demo but also `instant-meilisearch` and it will hot reload (if you run it with `yarn serve`).

The main purpose of this example is to showcase that instant-meilisearch can be easely included in an existing front-end application using `<script>` tags.

The demo in this directory showcases a basic search that will let you search through games names.

## Project setup

```bash
$ yarn install
```

### Compile and hot-reload for development

```

```

### Compile and minify for production

```

### Customize configuration
